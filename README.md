# Knowledge
My goal is to document my knowledge from all over the place: Software
Engineering, Computer Science, Economics, places I've lived, places I've
traveled, and more!

## Goals and History
You can read more about the history of this project and the initial goals in
my [introductory post] on my website.

## Contributing
Notice an error? I'll gladly accept any PR that fixes typos, semantic errors,
etc. I'll consider merging additional content, but only if the quality is high
enough that I would recommend it to a friend.
