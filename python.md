# Python
I love the Python programming language. Python is cross-platform, open-source,
imo is well-suited for:
- small utilities
- data analysis
- web scraping
- websites and web apps

and probably most importantly, it is an excellent teaching language.

For people new to programming in general and Python specifically, I recommend
the [Intro to Computer Science] course from [Udacity]

While this course was great for learning the syntax and logic with the
language, I hadn't learned how to run actual Python code on my computer (only
through their web interface). When I came back to Python after my forays in
Java, Bash, and Ruby, I learned from [Learn Python the Hard Way].

Websites and forums like [Project Euler] and [Reddit's Daily Programmer] were
great for learning more about programming in general and Python language
fundamentals specifically.

The [r/python] subreddit is a great resource for those who want to read more
about the language and the ecosystem in general. As always, forums like [Hacker
News] and [r/programming] are excellent resources because they expose you to
many different parts of programming, Computer Science, and the intersections of
those with the rest of the world.
